I am working on a project which I cloned from a remote repository hosted on GitLab. 

I made some changes to the project, but I didnâ€™t create any branch 
and want to now start work on some other new features, 
but without first pushing my existing work to the remote repository.

I might discard the changes in the new feature or might need to push both the new feature 
as well as the earlier changes to the remote repository, at a later stage.

From what I know about Git, I think I need to create a new local branch, 
which I can do using git checkout -b NEW_BRANCH_NAME. 

Is this the correct way to accomplish what I am trying to do? 

When I use this command, it creates a new branch. 
How do I switch back and forth between working on this new branch and the earlier one?
